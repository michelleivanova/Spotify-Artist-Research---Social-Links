## Important Notes

1. **Auto-Generated Links**: All social media URLs were automatically generated based on artist names. They follow common platform patterns but may not all be accurate.

2. **Verification Recommended**: For critical campaigns, verify URLs before use:
   - Check if profiles exist
   - Confirm they belong to the correct artist
   - Update with actual verified URLs

3. **Handle Cleaning**: Artist names were cleaned to create handles:
   - Converted to lowercase
   - Removed prefixes (DJ, Lil, Young, Big, The)
   - Removed special characters
   - Example: "DJ Isaac" → "isaac"

4. **Missing Links**: ~0.2% of artists don't have generated links (likely due to empty or invalid names in source data)
